on
the
,
on
our
group
only
.
only
the
tech
groups
.
which

,
and
like
,
so
that
is
personality
,
personality
test
for
the
take
test
<unk>
i
wonder
what
they
are
gonna
be
.
the
text
.
the
text
.
yeah
,
the
ques-
,
if
the
same
,
if
the
questions
are
gonna
be
the
same
.
they
are
not
gonna
be
the
same
.
the
results
are
gonna
be
the
same
,
i
am
thinking
.
ahem
.
the
only
difference
is
gonna
find
out
who
is
more
technical
than
the
other
one
<unk>
.
finally
got
those
two
students
paid
.
uh
,
byron
s
students
,
uh
,
parsa
and
badal
.
finally
,
they
are
gonna
cut
a
check
either
today
or
tomorrow
.
es
que
they
are
,
they
are
here
from
india
just
for
twenty
days
or
twenty-two
days
.
why
?
like
,
uh
.
well
they
were
students
,
but
he
uh
,
since
he
could
not
appoint
them
like
students
,
he
had
to
do
aps
<unk>
.
uh
,
they
are
helping
him
with
research
,
with
the
research
.
but
just
for
twenty
days
?
twenty
days
,
yeah
.
yeah
,
but
those
guys
are
there
everyday
.
yeah
.
aww
.
and
ummm
.
and
then
they
are
,
they
are
kind
of
watching
<unk>
what
we
are
doing
with
these
two
.
they
want
to
do
the
same
thing
over
there
.
they
want
to
bring
some
student
,
and
they
wanna
see
<unk>
how
much
it
costs
to
bring
?
dijo
,
well
,
how
much
did
you
have
to
pay
for
the
two
students
?
le
dijo
,
one
of
them
was
four
thousand
,
the
other
was
thirty-eight
hundred
.
for
tw-
twenty
days
?
yeah
,
but
that
includes
the
air
.
the
air
and
their
living
expenses
.
hello
.
ooh
,
where
were
they
staying
at
?
uh
,
in
an
apartment
,
i
think
.
in
a
sheridan
apartment
.
wow
.
it
is
just
a
thirty
day
apartment
.
so
,
ponle
que
hagan
?
i
mean
,
the
cheapest
must
be
six
,
seven
hundred
dollars
,
no
?
nah
?
there
is
one
near
by
university
the
,
whatever
it
is
called
.
is
that
where
the
hotel
is
gonna
come
handy
?
the
holiday
inn
?
possibly
,
but
that
would
be
expensive
,
that
would
still
be
more
expensive
than
an
apartment
.
that
would
not
be
for
people
like
them
.
hmm-hmm
,
no
.
oh
.
so
four
thousand
is
.
i
imagine
the
air
fare
must
have
been
up
there
in
a
thousand
at
least
.
oh
yeah
,
umm
.
three
hundred
plus
their
apartment
,
fifteen
hundred
.
there
is
another
two
.
plus
food
.
india
.
thousand
,
food
?
and
so
,
for
their
services
that
they
provided
.
what
kind
of
<unk>
?
<unk>
six
hundred
.
i
do
not
know
.
heard
they
were
doing
research
.
research
.
audio
.
it
is
probably
related
to
this
.
yeah
.
yeah
.
it
is
probably
related
to
that
.
probably
.
mmm-hmm
.
so
,
umm
,
you
know
,
it
took
me
forever
to
get
their
check
.
they
lost
,
you
know
the
one
that
they
said
that
they
had
mailed
you
?
si
?
they
are
still
looking
for
it
.
bah
,

umm
,
and
so
then
we
sent
another
one
.
and
,
well
they
lost
that
one
too
.
that
one
was
hand
carried
,
and
they
said
they

to
the
provost
office
,
i
called
the
provost
office
,
we
do
not
have
it
.
i
called
ericka
,
and
where
did
you
send
it
?
because
she
told
me
she
went
she

it
to
provost
.
oh
,
no
they
said
,
we
sent
it
to
orsp
<unk>
.
and
orsp

just
told
me
they
did
not
have

.
i
called

,
he
said
oh
,
yeah
i
got

.
le
dije
,
well
,
where

it
?
it
is

,
le
dije
,
i
am
sorry
,
i
do
not
know
where
upstairs
is
.
what
do
you
mean
it
is
upstairs
?
where
is
upstairs
?
dice
,
well
it
is
,
uh
,
in
the
reception
area
.
orsp
le
dije
,
and
where
is
it
going
next
?
digo
,
to
the
provost
office
.
le
dije
,
well
,
le
dije
i
put
a
big
note
that
said
rush
.
le
dije
,
for
that
reason
,
dije
,
i
do
not
want
it
sitting
in
the
reception
area
,
it
must
be
hand
carried
into
the
provost
now
.
mmm-hmm
.
le
dije
,
they
leave
tomorrow
,
you
know
,
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
i
have
to
have
the
check
before
then
.
so
,
uh
,
ok
.
i
will
tell
them
.
ok
!
and
i
thought
,
since
i
am
waiting
.
mmm-hmm
.
i
call
the
provost
office
,
and
they
said
they
had
kept
a
copy
of
the
first
one
,
the
one
that
was
lost
.
mmm-hmm
.
digo
,
i
have
a
copy
and
<unk>
le
dije
,
send
it
to
me
.
so
,
they
faxed
it
to
me
.
the
first
one
,
the
one
that
was
lost
,
with
signatures
,
all
the
way
up
to
the
provost
office
.
so
,
i
asked
the
president
's
office
whether
they
would
accept
that
and
all
they
need
is
just
the
president
's
signature
and
we
are
done
.
it
did
?
yeah
,
they
did
.
so
,
while
we
are
over
here
waiting
to
see
where
the
other
one
went
.
well
,
forget
it
.
i
went
and
had
and
got
the
copy
approved
.
and
i
sent
it
in
to
contracts
and
rent
.
mmm-hmm
.
and
they
approved
the
payment
,
while
the
others
are
still
looking
.
<unk>
va
a
haber
,
va
causar
confusión
porque
<unk>
mandan
al
president
.
they
will
approve
both
.
that
is
ok
.
nothing
is
gonna
happen
with
the
other
one
.
then
they
called
me
,
and
said
,
would
you
like
us
to
send
the
original
campus
mail
?
no
.
no
.
dije
,
i
will
send
somebody
over
there
to
go
get
it
.
so
,
i
sent
the
work
study
up
there
to
go
get
it
.
hmm
.
what
i
do
not
understand
is
that
,
if
we
have
work
studies
that
can
take
all
the
stuff
over
,
i
am
sure
the
president
's
office
does
too
.
but
,
maybe
they
just
have
an
overwhelming
amount
of
deliveries
to
make
.
they
should
have
their
own
people
i
do
not
know
.
but
,
if
they
do
it
once
a
day
,
get
them
all
together
.
the
provost
office
or
the
president
's
office
?
the
president
's
office
,
they
are
the
ones
that
lost
it
.
i
am
thinking
,
i
am
surprised
,
i
am
because
you
are
all
very
meticulous
about
making
copies
,
you
know
,
logging
it
in
,
logging
it
out
.
they
said
,
for
some
reason
we
did
not
make
a
copy
.
they
did
not
have
a
copy
.
they
did
not
.
and
,
they
did
not
and
they
did
not
have
the
original
.
they
said
,
the
original
went
to
computer
science
,
le
dije
,
that
was
two
weeks
ago
.
y
luego
le
erraron
y
no
llegó
<unk>
.
it
is
not
there
,
and
it
is
not
in
computer
science
.
did
they
send
it
on
campus
,
by
campus
?
one
time
,
they
told
me
that
,
that
they
had
sent
me
something
.
and
i
got
it
like
three
weeks
later
.
uh-huh
.
and
it
had
been
to
hinton
hall
.
uh
,
somebody
sat
,
in
sat
in
somebody
's
desk
,
you
know
in
hinton
hall
?
yeah
.
see
,
so
,
that
is
how
these
things
?
i
mean
,
it
is
gonna
show
up
eventually
,
yeah
.
but
it
is
gonna
make
the
rounds
around
campus
somewhere
.
si
sitting
on
somebody
's
desk
,
you
know
?
yeah
.
para
qué
la
quieren
?
yeah
.
no
,
porque
yo
,
cada
ratito
me
mandan
cosas
de
otros
,
and
i
have
to
send
them
back
.
uh-huh
.
hmm
.
did
i
tell
you
something
about
a
trailer
?
it
is
sitting
there
.
and
now
he
is
having
trouble
registering

yeah
,
i
did
not
even
know
you

register
the
trailer
.
yeah

you
have
to
register
trailers
